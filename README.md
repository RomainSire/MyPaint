# MyPaint
Simple JavaScript Paint-like application  
My attempts to create a drawing application, a little bit like the old MS Paint.  

The code is Object oriented for a better organization, and uses canvas.  
I used the library jQuery sometimes, especially for events listeners.  

Very fun and interesting to code!
